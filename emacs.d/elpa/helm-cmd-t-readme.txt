This package provides a helm source for repository (git, hg, etc) based
file selection.  The emphasis is on fast file-name completion.  The concept
of a "respository" is configurable through `helm-cmd-t-repo-types'.

Each repository is cached for fast access (see
`helm-cmd-t-cache-threshhold'), and in the future, options will be
available to interact with the repository (i.e. grep, etc).

`helm-cmd-t' is the simple predefined command that opens a file in the
current repository, however, it's highly recommended that you add a helm
source like recentf that keeps track of recent files you've worked with.
This way, you don't have to worry about your respository cache being out of
sync.  See "helm-C-x-b.el" for an example of a custom drop-in
replacement for `switch-to-buffer' or "C-x b".
