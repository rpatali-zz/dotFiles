# Installation script which setup up an Ubuntu Precise machine to use this

# WARNING!!!
# * This has only been tested on a limited number of machines running
#   Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.
# * This is not a sophisticated installation script by any stretch
#   of the imagination.
# * I take no responsibility if this overwrites any configuration settings
#   or otherwise messes up your system.
